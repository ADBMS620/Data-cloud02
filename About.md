## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. **Analyze Algorithm Complexity** → Evaluate computational time complexity using Python.
2. **Implement Recursive Solutions** → Identify recursive structures and implement them effectively.
3. **Understand UML Diagrams** → Explain and design software using **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**.
4. **Use Object-Oriented Programming** → Apply **OOP principles** to implement data structures.
5. **Work with Linear Regression** → Develop algorithms for **linear regression** by minimizing error.
6. **Classify Categorical Data** → Implement **logistic regression** for binary and multi-category classification.
7. **Evaluate Regression Models** → Use **mean square error, correlation coefficients, and confusion matrices**.
8. **Design State Machines** → Implement state machines using an object-oriented approach.
9. **Debug and Optimize Code** → Fix syntax and logic errors using debugging techniques.
