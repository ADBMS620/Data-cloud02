 ## What are Data Structures?
 
A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. The right choice of data structure can significantly improve the performance, scalability, and efficiency of an application.

### Common Types of Data Structures:

-Linear Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
-Hierarchical Data Structures: Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, B-Trees)
-Graph-Based Structures: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List
-Hashing Techniques: Hash Tables, Bloom Filters
-Advanced Data Structures: Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Tries

### 🔹 How to Master Data Structures & Algorithms?

🚀 Start with the basics – Learn fundamental data structures and their operations.
📝 Practice coding challenges – Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.
📖 Understand real-world applications – Study how DSA is used in databases, OS, AI, and blockchain.
👨‍💻 Follow structured courses – Read tutorials, watch videos, and implement algorithms in different languages.
