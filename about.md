## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

### Week 1: Python ([Concept Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dFasj8ePnDj0TPYWCRrrWckVQk21fjd/view?usp=sharing))

- Apply Python's **procedural** programming and **basic** data structures
- **Define** and **call** functions
- Implement:
  - Bubble sort and
  - Insertion sort algorithms to **sort** a sequence of number
- Use **print** statements to debug code

### Week 2: Analysing Programs ([Concept Map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PV9-Pe3D1AXhs4pao_70KnF3xyNcNX0P/view?usp=sharing))

- Write functions to do **binary heap** data structure operation
- Implement **heapsort** using iteration
- Define **Big-O** notation and other asymptotic notations
- Derive **complexity** of a code using its computation model
- Create **plots** from array data for **visualising** computational time
- **Measure** computation time for bubble sort, insertion sort, built-in sort, and heapsort
