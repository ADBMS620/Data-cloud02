# Introduction
Previously, we discussed two sorting algorithms called Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. In this section we will apply our programming skills to investigate another sorting algorithm called the Heapsort. We will then compare the performance of Heapsort with the previous sorting algorithms. We will discuss some notations on how to analyze these performance.

> üí° **WHY SO MANY SORTING ALGORITHMS?**  
> One reason why we introduce different sorting algorithms is to show you that there are many ways to solve the same problems.
> At the same time, these different ways may have different performances.  
> After we introduce binary heap and heapsort algorithm, we will begin to introduce how to analyze these different algorithms in terms of computation time.  
> You will notice that Heapsort algorithm is a much better sorting algorithm as compared to Bubble sort and Insertion sort algorithms.




# Binary Heap
Before discussing the Heapsort algorithm, we have to introduce a new data structure called binary heap or simply called heap.


``` text bf
 ‚ÑπÔ∏è HEAP  
 The heap is an array of objects that we can view as a nearly perfect binary tree  
 (or we can call it a *complete* binary tree).
```

> A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which **all** leaf nodes are at the same level.
> Complete binary trees are nearly perfect **except** the last level, and all the leaves at the last level are packed towards the left.


You are familiar with the concept of array. But what is a binary tree? The easiest way to explain it is using some examples.The image below shows you an array of integers.

![BinearyHeap](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/Binary_Heap1.png?raw=true)

## Binary Tree
We have indicated the indices of each element in the array, which starts from 0. We can visualize the elements in this array in a form of a tree as shown below.

![Binary Heap2](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-2.png?raw=true)



A tree in computer science is up-side down. It consists of nodes and it has one root node, which is at the top. In a binary tree, each node has only two children, which we will call the left child and the right child. Every node, except the root, has a parent node. The node without children is what we called a leaf.

Let's take a look at the example above and put in all the terms we have mentioned:
* In the above tree, we have 10 nodes, where each node is each element in the array.
* The root node is the element 16, which has an index 0 in the array.
* Node with element 16 (root node) has two children. The left child is a node with the element 14, while the right child is a node with the element 10.
* Elements 9, 3, 2, 4, and 1 are all leaves because they do not have any children.
* The node with element 7 (index 4) has only one child, which is the node with element 1 (index 9).
* The node with element 1 (index 9) has node with index 4 as its parent.

  Now, let's go back to our definition of a heap. The heap is an array of object that we can view as a nearly perfect binary tree.

* A binary tree is a tree where all the nodes have only a maximum of two children, which you can call left child and right child.
* A full binary tree is a tree where all the nodes except the leaves have two children. In our case, heap is a complete binary tree and not a full binary tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A complete binary tree is similar to a full binary tree with two major differences: all the leaf elements must lean toward the left and the last leaf element may not have the right sibling.
* The root of the tree is the node with index 0.
* We put the elements of our array into our tree from top to bottom and left to right sequence. With this, we can calculate the index of the children and the parent for every node.

## Indices of Children and Parent in a Heap
Let's start by considering how to calculate the index of the parent node. Let's take a look at the example tree we have considered.

![Binary Heap2](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-3.png?raw=true)

> ‚ö† **INDEX ‚â† NODE CONTENT**
>  The parent of node index 1 is 0. Similarly, the parent  of node index 2 is also 0. The parent of node index 3  and 4 is 1, while the parent of node index 5 and 6 is 2.

How do we get index 0 from both indices 1 and 2? And how do we get index 1 from indices 3 and 4? 
Or index 2 from indices 5 and 6?

We can test the above pseudocode. **(1‚àí1)/2=0** and **(2‚àí1)/2=0** for the second level nodes. Similarly, **(3‚àí1)/2=1 and (4‚àí1)/2=1** for the third-level nodes with the parent index **1**. And **(5‚àí1)/2=2** together with **(6‚àí1)/2=2** for the third level nodes with the parent index 2. Note that we use integer division to get the correct parent node.

## Left Child Index
n order to get the index of the left child, let's observe the following:
* The left child of node 0 is index 1.
* The left child of node 1 is index 3.
* The left child of node 2 is index 5.
* and so on.

We can get the left child index using the following:



## Right Child Index
Similarly, we can observe the following for the indices of the right child nodes:

* The right child of node 0 is index 2.
* The right child of node 1 is index 4.
* The right child of node 2 is index 6.
* and so on.


# Heap Property
There are two kinds of heap: max-heaps and min-heaps. In this case we will discuss only max-heaps. Both heaps must satisfy **heap property**, which specifies the kind of heap we are dealing with. The **max-heap property** is specified as follows:

> ### MAX HEAP PROPERTY
> For all nodes except the root:
>
> ```text
> A[parent(i)] >= A[i]
> ```

This means that in a max-heap, the parent nodes are always greater that their children. This also implies that the largest node is at the root. The figure below is an example of a max-heap because it satisfies the condition above.

![Binary Heap](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-4.png?raw=true)

 

# Maintaining The Heap Property with `Heapify`

We will now describe an algorithm on how to maintain the *heap property*, 
and in this example it is the **max-heap property**. We call the procedure 
to maintain the max-heap property **max-heapify**. The idea is that for a 
given node, we will ‚Äúpush down‚Äù this node in such a way that the 
max-heap property is satisfied. This assumes the *left child* of the given 
node already forms a tree that satisfies the max-heap property. Similarly, 
the *right child* of the given node also forms a tree that satisfies the 
max-heap property. The only part that does not satisfy the max-heap 
property is the current node and its two children.

## (P)roblem Statement

Given an index of a node in a binary tree, where the left and the right children 
of that node satisfy the *max-heap property*, restore the *max-heap property* 
of the tree starting from the current node.

```text
Input: index of the current node in a heap
Output: None
Process: re-order the elements in the heap
         in such a way that the max-heap property is satisfied
         from the current index node.

assumption:
 - left child forms a tree that satisfies max-heap property
 - right child forms a tree that satisfies max-heap property
 - current node with its children may not satisfy max-heap property
```
## Test (C)ase

Let's take a look at the tree below.

![Binary Heap 5](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-5.png?raw=true)


Note the following:

- The current node is **index 1**, which has the element of 4.
- The current node with its children does not satisfy the *max-heap property* 
  because `4 < 14` and `4 < 7`.
- The left child, i.e. the tree starting from index 3 (element 14, with children 
  of 2 and 8), forms a tree that satisfies the *max-heap property*.
- The right child, i.e. the tree starting from index 4 (element 7, with 
  one child of 1), forms a tree that satisfies the *max-heap property*.

The procedure of *max-heapify* will push the current node by swapping with the 
largest node along the way to satisfy the *max-heap property*. To do that, in 
the process of pushing the nodes, we will swap that node with the **largest child**. 
In this way, we satisfy the *max-heap property*.

Let's look at the particular example above. Given the tree above, we do the following:

- We first find the largest child of the current node. The current node is element 4 
  (index 1). The largest child is element 14 (index 3), which is the left child of 
  the current node.
  ![Binary Heap 6](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-6.png?raw=true)

- We then swap the current node with the largest child, i.e. element 4 (index 1) with element 14 (index 3).

  ![Binary Heap 7](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-7.png?raw=true)


- We, then, move our current index to the place where we swap, i.e. old index of element 14. So we are now at index 3.
- We do the same thing by looking if any of the children is larger than the current node. Since 8>4, we swap 4 (index 3) with 8 (index 8).

  ![Binary Heap 8](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-8.png?raw=true)

- We, then, move our current index to the place where we swap, i.e. old index of element 8. So we are now at index 8.
- Since this node has no more children, we stop. We can check whether the node has more children by calculating the index of the left child and see if it is still within the length of the array minus one, i.e. _**left(i)<n**_ if the node has at least one child, where i is the current node index and n is the number of element in the array.

# Design of Algorithm

## Max-Heapify v1

We can write down the steps we did in the previous section as follows.

  ```text
  def max-heapify(A, i):
  version: 1
  Input:
    - A = array storing the heap
    - i = index of the current node to restore max-heap property
  Output: None, restore the element in place
  Steps:
    1. current_i = i # current index starting from input i
    2. As long as ( left(current_i) < length of array), do:
      2.1 max_child_i = get the index of largest child of the node current_i
      2.2 if array[max_child_i] > array[current_i], do:
        2.2.1 swap( array[max_child_i], array[current_i])
        2.3 current_i = max_child_i # move to the index of the largest child
```

Note that the above steps will continue iterating down even if the current node already satisfies *max-heap* property. This means that we can stop iterating if the largest child is already less than the current node. We can do this by checking if any swap is happening. If no swap is needed then we are done. This is because we assume that the left child and the right child already satisfy *max-heap property*.



## Max-Heapify v2


 

  ```text
  def max-heapify(A, i):
  version: 2
  Input:
    - A = array storing the heap
    - i = index of the current node to restore max-heap property
  Output: None, restore the element in place
  Steps:
    1. current_i = i  # current index starting from input i
    2. swapped = True
    3. As long as ( left(current_i) < length of array) AND swapped, do:
      3.1 swapped = False
      3.2 max_child_i = get the index of largest child of the node current_i
      3.3 if array[max_child_i] > array[current_i], do:
        3.3.1 swap( array[max_child_i], array[current_i])
        3.3.2 swapped = True
      3.3.3 current_i = max_child_i  # move to the index of the largest child
   ```

  We introduced a boolean variable called swapped. At every iteration, we set *swapped* to *False*. If there is a swap, we set this boolean variable to *True* and continue to the next iteration. If there is no swap, the boolean variable is still *False* and so it will stop the iteration.

  # Building A Heap

We can then use the previous procedure *max-heapify* to build a **binary heap** data structure from any arbitrary array. The idea is to go through every node in the tree and *heapify* them. However, we need not do this for all the nodes, but rather only **half** of those nodes. The reason is that we do not need to heapify the **leaves**.

We can show that the elements in the array from index \( n/2 \) to \( n - 1 \) are all leaves. We do not need to push down these nodes as they do not have any children. So we can start from the element at position \( n/2 - 1 \) and move up to the element at position **0**.

## **(P)roblem Statement**

Given an arbitrary array, re-order the elements in such a way that it satisfies *max-heap property*.


## **Test (C)ases**

Let's consider an array as shown below.

```text
[1, 2, 8, 7, 14, 9, 3, 10, 4, 16]
```
We first visualize this array as a binary tree as shown below. Note that this tree does not satisfy max-heap property.

![Binary Heap 9](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-9.png?raw=true)


We will start from the middle index, i.e. \( n/2 - 1 = 10/2 - 1 = 4 \), which is the fifth element, i.e. **14**. Notice that all the elements after **14** are all *leaves*. 

We call *max-heapify* on **14**, and the result is a swap between **14** and **16**. We only have one iteration because now **14** has reached the end of the array and cannot be compared with any other nodes. 


In the figure below, we indicate the next element to consider with a *dotted* circle.

[1, 2, 8, 7,****14****, 9, 3, 10, 4, 16]

![Binary Heap10](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-10.png?raw=true)



[1, 2, 8, 7, ****16****, 9, 3, 10, 4, ****14****]

Now we move to the element on the left of 16, which is 7. The result of max-heapify will swap 7 with 10.

[1, 2, 8, ****7****, 16, 9, 3, 10, 4, 14]

![Binary Heap 11](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-11.png?raw=true)




[1, 2, 8,**10**, 16, 9, 3, 7, 4, 14]

Now, we move to the next element, which is 8. The result of max-heapify will swap 8 with 9.

[1, 2, **8**, 10, 16, 9, 3, 7, 4, 14]

![Binary Heap 12](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-12.png?raw=true)


[1, 2, **9**, 10, 16, **8**, 3, 7, 4, 14]

We move on to the next element, which is 2. The result of max-heapify will swap 2 with 16, and then 2 with 14.

[1, **2**, 9, 10, **16**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 14]

![Binary Heap 12](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-13.png?raw=true)


[1, **16**, 9, 10, **2**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 14]

and then,

[1, 16, 9, 10, **2**, 8, 3, 7, 4, **14**]

![Binary Heap 13](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-14.png?raw=true)



[1, 16, 9, 10, **14**, 8, 3, 7, 4, **2**]

And now we move to the last element, which is 1. The result of max-heapify will swap 1 with 16, and then 1 with 14, and finally 1 with 2.

[**1**, **16**, 9, 10, 14, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]

![Binary Heap 14](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-15.png?raw=true)


[**16**,**1**, 9, 10, 14, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]

next,

[16,**1**, 9, 10, **14**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]  

![Binary Heap 15](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-16.png?raw=true)


[16, **14**, 9, 10, **1**, 8, 3, 7, 4, 2]

Finally,

[16, 14, 9, 10, **1**, 8, 3, 7, 4, **2**]

![Binary Heap 16](https://github.com/ADBMS620/Data-cloud02/blob/master/docs/week-2/Bineary%20Heap/Binary_Heap-17.png?raw=true)


[16, 14, 9, 10, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, **1**]


> **NOTE**  
> Once we reach the last element, the whole array now satisfies the *max-heap property*.

# (D)esign of Algorithm

We can then write down the steps above as a pseudocode as follows:


  ```text
  def build-max-heap(array):
Input:
  - array: arbitrary array of integers
Output: None, sort the element in place
Steps:
1. n = length of array
2. starting_index = integer(n / 2) - 1 # start from the middle or non-leaf node
3. For current_index in Range(from starting_index down to 0), do:
    3.1 call max-heapify(array, current_index)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION**  
> The pseudo simply says, we start from the middle node as our `starting_index`, and call the function max-heapify on that node.  
> We then move to the left and continue calling max-heapify until we reach the first element at index 0.
