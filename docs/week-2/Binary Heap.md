## Binary Heap
Binary heap is a complete binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property,
where the key of each parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap)
the keys of its child nodes.
## Goals
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

<li>Implement binary heap using Python's built-in list<l/i>
<li>Describe heap property<l/i>
<li>Describe the steps to build heap<l/i>
<li>Implement algorithm to restore heap property<l/i>
<li>Write functions to do binary heap data structure operation<l/i>
