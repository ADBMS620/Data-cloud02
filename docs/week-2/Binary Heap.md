## Binary Heap
Binary heap is a complete binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property,where the key of each parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap)the keys of its child nodes.
## Goals
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

<li>Implement binary heap using Python's built-in list<l/i>
<li>Describe heap property<l/i>
<li>Describe the steps to build heap<l/i>
<li>Implement algorithm to restore heap property<l/i>
<li>Write functions to do binary heap data structure operation<l/i>

## Keywords 
<b> tree, binary tree, root, binary heap, heap property, heapify, node, leaf, parent node, child node<b>

## Introduction
Previously, we discussed two sorting algorithms called Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. In this section we will apply our programming skills to investigate another sorting algorithm called the Heapsort. We will then compare the performance of Heapsort with the previous sorting algorithms. We will discuss some notations on how to analyze these performance.
