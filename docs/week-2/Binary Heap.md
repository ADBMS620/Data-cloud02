## Binary Heap
Binary heap is a complete binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property,where the key of each parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap)the keys of its child nodes.
## Goals
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

<li>Implement binary heap using Python's built-in list<l/i>
<li>Describe heap property<l/i>
<li>Describe the steps to build heap<l/i>
<li>Implement algorithm to restore heap property<l/i>
<li>Write functions to do binary heap data structure operation<l/i>

## Keywords 
<b> tree, binary tree, root, binary heap, heap property, heapify, node, leaf, parent node, child node<b>

## Introduction
Previously, we discussed two sorting algorithms called Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. In this section we will apply our programming skills to investigate another sorting algorithm called the Heapsort. We will then compare the performance of Heapsort with the previous sorting algorithms. We will discuss some notations on how to analyze these performance.

  <h3>WHY SO MANY SORTING ALGORITHMS?</h3>
  <p>
    One reason why we introduce different sorting algorithms is to
    show you that there are many ways to solve the same problems.
    At the same time, these different ways may have different
    performances.After we introduce binary heap and heapsort algorithm, we will
    begin to teach you how to analyze these different algorithms in
    terms of computation time. You will notice that the Heapsort
    algorithm is a much better sorting algorithm compared to Bubble
    sort and Insertion sort.

## Binary Heap
Before discussing the Heapsort algorithm, we have to introduce a new data structure called binary heap or simply called heap.

  <strong>‚ùó HEAP</strong>
  <p>
    The heap is an array of objects that we can view as a 
    nearly perfect binary tree (or we can call it a 
    <em>complete</em> binary tree).
  </p>
</div>

> A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which **all** leaf nodes are at the same level.
> Complete binary trees are nearly perfect **except** the last level, and all the leaves at the last level are packed towards the left.


You are familiar with the concept of array. But what is a binary tree? The easiest way to explain it is using some examples.The image below shows you an array of integers.

## Binary Tree
We have indicated the indices of each element in the array, which starts from 0. We can visualize the elements in this array in a form of a tree as shown below.
