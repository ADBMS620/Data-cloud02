## Quick Sort
QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
## Goals
The primary goal of the quicksort algorithm is to efficiently sort an array or list of elements by using a divide-and-conquer approach, partitioning the array around a <b>pivot</b> element and recursively sorting the resulting sub-arrays.
## Keywords
<b>Pivot,Divide and Conquer, Partition the Array, Recurssion.</b>
## Introduction
Quicksort is a <b>divide-and-conquer</b> algorithm. It works by selecting a <b>pivot</b> element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
